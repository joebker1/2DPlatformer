# 2DPlatformer
## This game is like Super Mario Bros, where it is a platformer where the player collects coins as they complete the level.
## The player has to avoid hazards and collect coins to get a highscore as they complete the level in a set amount of time and with at least one life.
## This assignment was the final project of the beginner game design class. We had to complete a platformer that has hazards that harm the player with an end game.
## We also had to add any asthetics we could add like music and and make the level nicer than just a bare level.
### This was a class project, please do not copy this assigment, but please feel free to reference this code.
